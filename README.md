<h2>🚀 About Me</h2>

<p>
Backend Developer specialized in building <strong>scalable platforms</strong>, <strong>robust APIs</strong>, and 
<strong>distributed systems</strong>, with a strong focus on code quality, maintainability, and long-term evolution.
</p>

<p>
I currently work on <strong>UK Platform</strong>, the technological core of a large-scale educational platform used by a university. 
The platform centralizes authentication, content management, assessments, communication, and analytics.
It is built with a <strong>modular architecture</strong>, <strong>asynchronous processing</strong>, and multiple external integrations,
prioritizing <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>traceability</strong>, and <strong>security</strong>.
</p>

<p>
My main stack includes <strong>NestJS</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, integrating 
<strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, and <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.
I actively participate in architectural decisions, data modeling, and the design of critical workflows.
I have experience taking products from <strong>MVP to production</strong>, operating real systems with active users.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I’ve been working on <strong>AI applied to product development</strong>, including automated content moderation,
embedding-based systems, document processing, and <strong>LLM-driven workflow automation</strong>,
always from a pragmatic, business-oriented perspective.
</p>

<p>
I’m motivated by building software that <strong>scales</strong>, is <strong>clear to maintain</strong>, and solves <strong>real-world problems</strong>.
I value strong technical teams, good communication, and challenges where engineering makes a tangible impact.
